# Let's Talk Houseplants

An informational website. The purpose is to provide basic information related to the houseplants.
 
## UX

By Facebook research of plant-lovers groups we tried to find out what they expect from information page:
- As a user, I want to find information I need.
- As a user, I like to watch photos of home design with plants to get inspired.


## Features

### Existing Features
- Fixed menu allows user to easily navigate between website pages.
- Home page has Bootstrap grid system, which improves sites responsiveness. It doesn't look overcrowded on mobile phones.
- Gallery has simple layout and filled with eye catching and inspiring photos.
- User can fill in form in contact page to ask questions related to plants.


### Features Left to Implement
- Add more plants and organise adding categories
- Create houseplants website with full descriptions and care tips.

## Technologies Used

- HTML used to create basic site.
- CSS used to add style.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) used to improve responsiveness
- [Mockups](https://mockups-design.com/) used to create design.


## Testing

Page works fine on different screens, however menu bar isn't responsive in opera browser large screen.


## Credits

All code was written by me using Bootstrap.
