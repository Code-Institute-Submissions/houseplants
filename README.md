# Let's Talk Houseplants

An informational website. The purpose is to provide basic information related to the houseplants.
 
## UX

By Facebook research of plant-lovers groups we tried to find out what they expect from information page:
- As a user, I want to find information I need.
- As a user, I like to watch photos of home design with plants to get inspired.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features

### Existing Features
- Fixed menu allows user to easily navigate between website pages.
- Home page has Bootstrap grid system, which improves sites responsiveness. It doesn't look overcrowded on mobile phones.
- Gallery has simple layout and filled with eye catching and inspiring photos.
- User can fill in form in contact page to ask questions related to plants.

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Add more plants and organise adding categories
- Create houseplants website with full descriptions and care tips.

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- HTML used to create basic site.
- CSS used to add style.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) used to improve responsiveness
- [Mockups](https://mockups-design.com/) used to create design.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This site is hosted using GitHub page, deployed from master branch. Site will update automatically with new commits to the master branch.
